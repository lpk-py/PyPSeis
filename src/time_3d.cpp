/*        slowness values, now forbidden in hs). Their only justification    */
/*        is improved portability.                                           */
/*        The changes are the following :                                    */
/*        - The program now conforms to ANSI-C (you must include fdtimes.h   */
/*          in your calling program, if it is written in C).                 */
/*        - I decided to drop Sun-specific calls to routines implementing    */
/*          the IEEE standards for infinity and related tests. This is non   */
/*          portable, and would even create problems on Sun platforms when   */
/*          the calling program is in Fortran !                              */
/*          As a consequence, a finite threshold is now used to test whether */
/*          a float is treated as infinite. No value in array hs is allowed  */
/*          to exceed this threshold (see macro FD_HUGE below).              */
/*        - Unpredictible crashes were seldom encountered on Intel based PCs */
/*          due to the fact that the routine's behaviour strongly depended   */
/*          on tests comparing floats in an "exact" manner (e.g., replacing  */
/*          a test x<y by x<=y altered significantly the code behaviour).    */
/*          These tests are now "fuzzified" with no significant consequence  */
/*          on precision (using macro EPS_FUZZY below).                      */
/*                                                                           */
/*        In 2005, Ari Trygvasson and Bjorn Bergman signaled an unexpected   */
/*        asymmetry of results in a particular case. The initialization      */
/*        procedure was found to provide wrong results when the source was   */
/*        located at the immediate vicinity of a velocity heterogeneity      */
/*        (with significant but not severe impact on precision). A quite     */
